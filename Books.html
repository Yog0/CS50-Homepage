    <button class="book-title">Man's Search for Meaning, by Viktor Frankl</button>
    <div class="book-body">
        <p>
        This is an incredible book, and one I'd recommend to anyone unreservedly. Frankl is a Holocaust survivor who spent time in multiple Nazi concentration camps through World War 2. He gives a very simple
        history of that time - descriptions of the deaths of his friends are horrific, but almost matter-of-fact. He uses this to illustrate the central concept of his philosophy: that we can't 
        change what happens around us, but we can choose how to react to it. Our primary drive is not pleasure, but the search for meaning.

    <button class="book-title">Sapiens, by Yuval Noah Harari</button>
    <div class="book-body">
        <p>
        Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens is one of the most successful and influential popular science books of the last decade. Harari's style is simple and engaging, and provides
        simple explanations for the rise of our species to global dominance. A major part of this is that we have the ability to create a shared reality from things that don't actually 
        physically exist - think money, religion, or human rights. This allows us to cooperate with total strangers to a shared end - something impossible in other animals. This 
        book was extremely influential, and frequently made me reconsider my assumptions about the world.

    <button class="book-title">Slaughterhouse-Five, by Kurt Vonnegut</button>

    <div class="book-body">
        <p>
        Slaughterhouse-Five is a classic. It reads like nothing else. The book has a semi-autographical aspect that deals with the bombing of Dresden in World War 2, combined with 
        sci-fi existentialism in Vonnegut's distinctive style. Just read it.
